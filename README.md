# hackforplayer
A player for hackforplay-embed in any website.


## Plan

https://trello.com/b/gxWQpAnW/opensource-hackforplay


## How to use

Sorry, but now we are worked in **chrome only!!** X-P

1. Clone this repo (or download zip)
2. Open *example/local.html* your browser **as local file**
3. Ready? Let's click *HACK* and start hack-for-play!!


## How it works

Default code is written in 
```html
<script id="script1" type="hack">...</script>
```

But **it works in the iframe**.
You can write only **inline tags in html** (DON'T load local .js file).


### How iframe works. Why iframe?

It provides that **just local scope** can work javascript.
